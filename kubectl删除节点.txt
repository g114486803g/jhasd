kubectl delete node k8s-node  <<<<-----要删除得节点名称


node节点上执行

清空节点
kubeadm reset

重新加入新集群
kubeadm join 2.1.1.20:6443 --token xrvzem.kvpsmfmhj6c1rw88     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:f11695a0fc45acadaa42de2bfe1b5fe9e9bcc682048b0b291de142a4a2551910

如下:



[root@test ~]# kubeadm reset

The reset process does not reset or clean up iptables rules or IPVS tables.
If you wish to reset iptables, you must do so manually by using the "iptables" command.

If your cluster was setup to utilize IPVS, run ipvsadm --clear (or similar)
to reset your system's IPVS tables.

The reset process does not clean your kubeconfig files and you must remove them manually.
Please, check the contents of the $HOME/.kube/config file.

* The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on the control-plane to see this node join the cluster.


想彻底清空可以使用

ifconfig cni0 down
ip link delete cni0
ifconfig flannel.1 down
ip link delete flannel.1
rm -rf /var/lib/cni/
